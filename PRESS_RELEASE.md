There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > A shared TRL-esque experience where viewers can vote for what video to watch next!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Glitch targets people who enjoy actively watching multimedia in a social setting.

## Summary ##
  > Glitch is a platform which allows users to simultaneously view a dynamic, user-generated queue of videos and chat in real time.  Glitch users enjoy the fun of watching, listening to and discussing videos that they and other Glitch users have voted for.  

## Problem ##
  > Despite the increasing prevalance of social media, the act of watching Youtube videos remains a solitary activity. Internet users who watch Youtube videos can only discuss and share videos asynchronously, by leaving comments on a Youtube video or sharing a link to a Youtube video on Facebook or some other social media platform. 

## Solution ##
  > Glitch turns the solitary experience of watching Youtube videos into a social one.  By integrating chat functionality into the viewing experience, Glitch users can discuss what they're watching with other Glitch users as the videos play.  

## Quote from You ##
  > "I'm so proud to own this product." - Anton Solomonik

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I was so alone, watching Youtube videos by myself in my living room with the lights off.  Now I can watch Minecraft Youtube videos with other like-minded folk, who see the world as an elaborate series of cubes.  Thanks Glitch!" - Minney McMinerson

  > "Before Glitch, my wife and I would watch our own queues of Youtube videos after a long day of work.  Initially, we tried to keep up with each other's video queues by commenting on each other's videos.  But leaving Youtube comments and playing 'comment tag' became too difficult to keep up with, and we eventually gave up on sharing Youtube videos with each other altogether.  Once we started using Glitch, everything changed.  We now can watch the same queue of Youtube videos from our own computers and even chat about Taylor Swift's new hair color while watching 'Wild Dreams.' Glitch saved our marriage.  Thanks Glitch!"

## How to Get Started / Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Just go to our website (https://sleepy-falls-4522.herokuapp.com/) and start watching and sharing your favorite Youtube videos.  The only thing you need to know is that any video request should be preceded with an exclamation mark, (e.g., "!tswift")
